<p> At the party, Mika felt out of place at first. Everyone around her was laughing, dancing, and drinking. Rotem handed her a cup.</p>
    <p> "Come on, Mika, just one drink. You deserve to let loose!" </p>
    <p>Mika hesitated but gave in. "Just one," she told herself</p>
    <p> the night went on, the music got louder, and Mika found herself swept up in the energy. She drank more than she intended, and soon she was stumbling, laughing uncontrollably, and saying things she wouldn't normally say.</p>
<br>
<p>rotem and Tomer thought it was hilarious. They pulled out their phones and started recording her.</p>
  <p> "Mika! Say that again, its going on my story!" Tomer laughed.</p>
