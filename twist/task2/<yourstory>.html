        <h1>Under Pressure </h1>
        
<p> Mika was a 16-year-old girl, social yet slightly different from her friends. She loved painting and reading books more than going to parties.</p> 
<p>Her friends, however, thrived on drama and the thrill of always being in the spotlight</p> 
<p>Although Mika loved the group, she often felt it was hard to keep up with their pace.</p> 

<h2>what to do? </h2>
<p>The group couldnt stop talking about the upcoming party on Friday.</p>
<p> Everyone was excited, but Mika knew she had a math test on Sunday and needed to study.</p>
<br>
<p>"You're not coming?" Rotem, her best friend, asked with a tone of disapproval.</p>
<p>"I can't. I have a test," Mika replied.</p>
<p>"A test?" Rotem laughed. "Youre always studying. Who wants to stay friends with someone so boring?"</p> <br>
