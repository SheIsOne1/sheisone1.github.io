    <p class="narrative">
      In the ruins of a post-apocalyptic world, society lies in tatters. The only one to survive is a low-poly politician with a secret too dark to bear.
      To silence the past and secure his future, he must destroy the evidence of his participation in the downfall. The key to this final act lies within a sealed safeâ€”
      unlocked only by deciphering a cryptic word riddle.
    </p>
    <p class="subtitle">Enter the password to open the safe and erase your history.</p>
